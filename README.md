# Senior Frontend/UI Developer Test Submission

This repository contains both the **technical test** and the **written response** for the Senior Frontend/UI Developer role.

## 1. Technical Test: Promo Card Project

This is a **responsive promo card** project, created to demonstrate frontend development skills including component reusability, responsive design, and creativity in hover states. The project follows the provided Figma design specifications and includes the following features:

- **BEM Methodology**: The CSS is structured using the **BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)** methodology for modular and reusable styles.
- **Hover Effects**: Creative hover states are implemented for buttons and cards to enhance user interaction.
- **SEO Optimized**: Basic SEO techniques have been applied, including appropriate meta tags and clean semantic HTML for better search engine visibility.
