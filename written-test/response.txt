Subject: Books Archive Display Issue Resolved 


Hi Bob,

I hope this message finds you well. I sincerely apologize for the issue you experienced with the Books Archive page on your iPhone, and I appreciate you bringing the display problem to our attention. We understand how important it is for everything to look right, and I’m sorry for any frustration this may have caused.

I’m pleased to inform you that the problem has been fully resolved. The page was not properly responsive, meaning it didn’t automatically adjust to fit smaller screens like your iPhone. This led to the books appearing inconsistently and too small.

To address this, I’ve updated the page to be fully responsive so it adapts smoothly to any screen size. The books will now appear one per row on your iPhone, as you requested, providing a clearer and more consistent experience.

Your feedback has been invaluable. We've used it to enhance the site’s appearance on all devices and to improve the overall browsing experience. Please take a moment to check it out and let me know if everything looks good to you.

If you need any further assistance or have additional suggestions, don’t hesitate to reach out — I’m here to help!

Thank you again for your understanding and patience.

Best regards,  
Sheyi.
